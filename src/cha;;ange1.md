## Steganography
Quantum steganography is the art of secretly transmitting quantum information while disguising the fact that any secret communication is taking place. Like classical steganography, this involves embedding the hidden communication within a seemingly innocent “covertext,” which in the quantum case is a quantum state. [1].
